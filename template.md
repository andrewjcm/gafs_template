### My Post, My Rules | General Etiquette for GAFS
* All prices include shipping and are ‚Äùor best offer‚Äù, everything is negotiable; shoot your shot honey!
* Dibs in the thread is a full price commitment; the item is yours, you bought it Sparky.
* Posting dibs and then haggling is a dick move; don‚Äôt be a dick!
* Post PMing in the thread, then haggle. But a dibs trump‚Äôs your chat, you lose.
* Don‚Äôt ghost me! I will wait.... 60 minutes for payment, then move on
* If you find a lower price somewhere on the web, go ahead and post the link, I'll beat that price!
